/** \brief Native QF Event Queue
*
* This structure describes the native QF event queue, which can be used as
* the event queue for active objects, or as a simple "raw" event queue for
* thread-safe event passing among non-framework entities, such as ISRs,
* device drivers, or other third-party components.
*
* The native QF event queue is configured by defining the macro
* #QF_EQUEUE_TYPE as ::QEQueue in the specific QF port header file.
*
* The ::QEQueue structure contains only data members for managing an event
* queue, but does not contain the storage for the queue buffer, which must
* be provided externally during the queue initialization.
*
* The event queue can store only event pointers, not the whole events. The
* internal implementation uses the standard ring-buffer plus one external
* location that optimizes the queue operation for the most frequent case
* of empty queue.
*
* The ::QEQueue structure is used with two sets of functions. One set is for
* the active object event queue, which needs to block the active object
* task when the event queue is empty and unblock it when events are posted
* to the queue. The interface for the native active object event queue
* consists of the following functions: QActive_postFIFO(),
* QActive_postLIFO(), and QActive_get(). Additionally the function
* QEQueue_init() is used to initialize the queue.
*
* The other set of functions, uses this structure as a simple "raw" event
* queue to pass events between entities other than active objects, such as
* ISRs. The "raw" event queue is not capable of blocking on the get()
* operation, but is still thread-safe because it uses QF critical section
* to protect its integrity. The interface for the "raw" thread-safe queue
* consists of the following functions: QEQueue_postFIFO(),
* QEQueue_postLIFO(), and QEQueue_get(). Additionally the function
* QEQueue_init() is used to initialize the queue.
*
* \note Most event queue operations (both the active object queues and
* the "raw" queues) internally use  the QF critical section. You should be
* careful not to invoke those operations from other critical sections when
* nesting of critical sections is not supported.
*
* \sa ::QEQueueTag for the description of the data members
*/

    * When the queue is empty (which is most of the time), the extra
    * frontEvt location allows to bypass the ring buffer altogether,
    * greatly optimizing the performance of the queue. Only bursts of events
    * engage the ring buffer.
