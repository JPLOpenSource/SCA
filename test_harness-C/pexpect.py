"""Pexpect is a Python module for spawning child applications and controlling
them automatically. Pexpect can be used for automating interactive applications
such as ssh, ftp, passwd, telnet, etc. It can be used to a automate setup
scripts for duplicating software package installations on different servers. It
can be used for automated software testing. Pexpect is in the spirit of Don
Libes' Expect, but Pexpect is pure Python. Other Expect-like modules for Python
require TCL and Expect or require C extensions to be compiled. Pexpect does not
use C, Expect, or TCL extensions. It should work on any platform that supports
the standard Python pty module. The Pexpect interface focuses on ease of use so
that simple tasks are easy.

There are two main interfaces to Pexpect -- the function, run() and the class,
spawn. You can call the run() function to execute a command and return the
output. This is a handy replacement for os.system().

For example:
    pexpect.run('ls -la')

The more powerful interface is the spawn class. You can use this to spawn an
external child command and then interact with the child by sending lines and
expecting responses.

For example:
    child = pexpect.spawn('scp foo myname@host.example.com:.')
    child.expect ('Password:')
    child.sendline (mypassword)

This works even for commands that ask for passwords or other input outside of
the normal stdio streams.

    then returns all output as a string. STDERR is included in output.
    If the full path to the command is not given then the path is searched.

    Note that lines are terminated by CR/LF (\\r\\n) combination
    even on UNIX-like systems because this is the standard for pseudo ttys.
    If you set withexitstatus to true, then run will return a tuple of
    (command_output, exitstatus). If withexitstatus is false then this
    returns just command_output.

    The run() function can often be used instead of creating a spawn instance.
    For example, the following code uses spawn:
        from pexpect import *
        child = spawn('scp foo myname@host.example.com:.')
        child.expect ('(?i)password')
        child.sendline (mypassword)
    The previous code can be replace with the following, which you may
    or may not find simpler:
        from pexpect import *
        run ('scp foo myname@host.example.com:.', events={'(?i)password': mypassword})

    Examples:
    Start the apache daemon on the local machine:
        from pexpect import *
        run ("/usr/local/apache/bin/apachectl start")
    Check in a file using SVN:
        from pexpect import *
        run ("svn ci -m 'automatic commit' my_file.py")
    Run a command and capture exit status:
        from pexpect import *
        (command_output, exitstatus) = run ('ls -l /bin', withexitstatus=1)

    Tricky Examples:   
    The following will run SSH and execute 'ls -l' on the remote machine.
    The password 'secret' will be sent if the '(?i)password' pattern is ever seen.
        run ("ssh username@machine.example.com 'ls -l'", events={'(?i)password':'secret\n'})

    This will start mencoder to rip a video from DVD. This will also display
    progress ticks every 5 seconds as it runs.
        from pexpect import *
        def print_ticks(d):
            print d['event_count'],
        run ("mencoder dvd://1 -o video.avi -oac copy -ovc copy", events={TIMEOUT:print_ticks}, timeout=5)

    The 'events' argument should be a dictionary of patterns and responses.
    Whenever one of the patterns is seen in the command out
    run() will send the associated response string. Note that you should
    put newlines in your string if Enter is necessary.
    The responses may also contain callback functions.
    Any callback is function that takes a dictionary as an argument.
    The dictionary contains all the locals from the run() function, so
    you can access the child spawn object or any other variable defined
    in run() (event_count, child, and extra_args are the most useful).
    A callback may return True to stop the current run process otherwise
    run() continues until the next event.
    A callback may also return a string which will be sent to the child.
    'extra_args' is not used by directly run(). It provides a way to pass data to
    a callback function through run() through the locals dictionary passed to a callback.

        """This is the constructor. The command parameter may be a string
        that includes a command and any arguments to the command. For example:

            p = pexpect.spawn ('/usr/bin/ssh user@example.com')
            p = pexpect.spawn ('ls -latr /tmp')
        You may also construct it with a list of arguments like so:
            p = pexpect.spawn ('/usr/bin/ftp', [])
            p = pexpect.spawn ('/usr/bin/ssh', ['user@example.com'])
            p = pexpect.spawn ('ls', ['-latr', '/tmp'])
        After this the child application will be created and
        will be ready to talk to. For normal use, see expect() and 
        send() and sendline().

        The maxread attribute sets the read buffer size.
        This is maximum number of bytes that Pexpect will try to read
        from a TTY at one time.
        Seeting the maxread size to 1 will turn off buffering.
        Setting the maxread value higher may help performance in cases
        where large amounts of output are read back from the child.
        This feature is useful in conjunction with searchwindowsize.
        
        The searchwindowsize attribute sets the how far back in
        the incomming seach buffer Pexpect will search for pattern matches.
        Every time Pexpect reads some data from the child it will append the data to
        the incomming buffer. The default is to search from the beginning of the
        imcomming buffer each time new data is read from the child.
        But this is very inefficient if you are running a command that
        generates a large amount of data where you want to match
        The searchwindowsize does not effect the size of the incomming data buffer.
        You will still have access to the full buffer after expect() returns.
        
        The logfile member turns on or off logging.
        All input and output will be copied to the given file object.
        Set logfile to None to stop logging. This is the default.
        Set logfile to sys.stdout to echo everything to standard output.
        The logfile is flushed after each write.
        Example 1:
            child = pexpect.spawn('some_command')
            fout = file('mylog.txt','w')
            child.logfile = fout
        Example 2:
            child = pexpect.spawn('some_command')
            child.logfile = sys.stdout
            
        The delaybeforesend helps overcome a weird behavior that many users were experiencing.
        The typical problem was that a user would expect() a "Password:" prompt and
        then immediately call sendline() to send the password. The user would then
        see that their password was echoed back to them. Passwords don't
        normally echo. The problem is caused by the fact that most applications
        print out the "Password" prompt and then turn off stdin echo, but if you
        send your password before the application turned off echo, then you get
        your password echoed. Normally this wouldn't be a problem when interacting
        with a human at a real heyboard. If you introduce a slight delay just before 
        writing then this seems to clear up the problem. This was such a common problem 
        for many users that I decided that the default pexpect behavior
        should be to sleep just before writing to the child application.
        1/10th of a second (100 ms) seems to be enough to clear up the problem.
        You can set delaybeforesend to 0 to return to the old behavior.
        
        Note that spawn is clever about finding commands on your path.
        It uses the same logic that "which" uses to find executables.

        If you wish to get the exit status of the child you must call
        the close() method. The exit or signal status of the child will be
        stored in self.exitstatus or self.signalstatus.
        If the child exited normally then exitstatus will store the exit return code and
        signalstatus will be None.
        If the child was terminated abnormally with a signal then signalstatus will store
        the signal value and exitstatus will be None.
        If you need more detail you can also read the self.status member which stores
        the status returned by os.waitpid. You can interpret this using
        os.WIFEXITED/os.WEXITSTATUS or os.WIFSIGNALED/os.TERMSIG.
