This is the test harness for C generated state-machines.
There is a default MagicDraw model here called SeisTransaction.mdxml which contains a state-machine called SeisTransaction


Prerequisites:
--------------
Make sure the QF_C is built first - go into the ../QF_C directory and build

To Build
----------
- make clean all

To run:
-------
- setup.py


Modify the default model and re-run
------------------------------------
Startup MagicDraw
- mduml&
Make mods to the model and save
- make autoclean
- make auto
- If you added any new implementation files you will need to modify the Impl.c or .h in this directory
- make clean all


Try a different model:
-----------------------

Edit the Makefile - the CLASSNAME is the name of the MadicDraw mdxml file
SMNAME is the name of the state-machine

Edit the file 'config.dat'
The first column is the name of the State-machine
The second column is some instantiation name of your choice.

Generate the glue code
- gengluecode.py

Build
- make autoclean
- make auto
Move the generated implementation files to this directory
- mv autocode/<smName>Impl.c .
- mv autocode/<smName>Impl.h .

Build
- make clean all
