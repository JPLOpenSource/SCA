Test.pdf contains the graphical Test state-machine from the MD Test.xml

Run the model through the spin simulator:
-----------------------------------------
> spin autocode/Main.pml


Run the spin output through logscope:
--------------------------------------
> spin -u8000 autocode/Main.pml | convert.scala > log
> /Users/watney/logscope/logscope log spec

The -u8000 parameter tells spin to run 8000 steps

The file 'spec' contains the monitor specifications.
It also contains the state-machine hierarchy, so if the state-machine changes then so should this file.

The file 'convert.scala' is a scala script that translates the output from my spin model into a format that logscope can deal with.  Once again if anything changes in the state-machine, then this file also needs to change
