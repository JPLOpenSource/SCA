If you do a make clean, you will have to copy all the pml files to the autocode directory because this model has a lot of customization to get it to work:
- Order of including the Rover and Arm model in the Main.pml
- Removing some publishing of events in the driver in the Init.pml
- Publishing an internal event still has some issues when the input queues have filled up.  A modification in Rover.pml was made so as not to send yourself an event on a publish.


> make clean all
> cp *.pml autocode

To run the Spin simulation model:
----------------------------------
> spin autocode/Main.pml

To run the SPIN verification model:
------------------------------------
> spin -a autocode/Main.pml
> gcc -DSAFETY -o model pan.c 
> model

To replay a trail file:
-----------------------
> mv Main.pml.trail autocode/
> spin -t -r autocode/Main.pml


To verify the log file with LogScope:
--------------------------------------
> spin -u10000 autocode/Main.pml | convert.scala > log
> /Users/watney/logscope/logscope log spec

Note:  There should be some errors because in this model the Rover can be driving while the Arm is extended.  Only these errors should be reported.
